## Hello there!
I create web apps using PHP with the Laravel framework as well as mobile apps primarily using React Native. I consider myself a full-stack developer because I'm proficient with every layer of an application. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as much as possible. Aside from programming, I have a background in graphic design so not only can I make functional and robust software, I can also make it look good!
