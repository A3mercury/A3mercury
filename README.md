## ðŸ‘€ Hello there!
I create web apps using PHP with the Laravel framework as well as mobile apps primarily using React Native. I consider myself a full-stack developer because I'm proficient with every layer of an application. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as much as possible. Aside from programming, I have a background in graphic design so not only can I make functional and robust software, I can also make it look good!

## ðŸ“ˆ Work History
### **Photojojo** - Full-Stack Laravel developer, _Employeed from May 2015 to January 2016_
Photojojo was an eCommerce platform where we sold mobile and mobile camera accessories. I was apart of a 2 man team who designed and developed the entire website from scratch using PHP with the Laravel 5 framework, MySQL, and basic Blade, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Since I was right out of college, I was able to really cut my teeth on how to build an entire web and eCommerce platform from scratch. 

My job as a junior Laravel developer was to create and manage all the of the model relationships, write basic CRUD operations during the inital project setup, and build almost the entire cart system using JavaScript and some jQuery. 

### **SmartBridge** - Cross-Platform Mobile and ASP.NET Web Consultant, _Employeed from March 2016 to October 2016_
SmartBridge is a consulting firm in Houston, Texas focused on B2B technologies and innovations. Part of my job was to help manage client relations during the inital requirements phase of development and gain understanding on how the client wanted the projects to function. My main job was an ASP.NET MVC developer as well as a Cross-Platform Mobile Applications developer using C#, .NET, and Xamarin.

### **Appleton Talent/Spur** - Full-Stack Laravel and Ionic Mobile developer, _Employeed from October 2016 to February 2018_
When I started at Appleton Talent, I helped manage a SAAS application for managing staffing for public schools. This included HR, Payroll, Absense tracking, etc. for teachers and staff. This was a Laravel 5+ application using PostreSQL, Angular, Vue, and some jQuery. My job at the beginning was to help fix bugs, add features, and help our support staff with issues they had with the platform. 

After a year there, focused shifted from that application to a new cross-platform mobile application called Spur. My job here was to add new features to the Laravel API backend as well as the front-end views in Ionic using TypeScript. 

### **Dealer Inspire** - Inventory Support developer, _Employeed from October 2018 to present_
My job at DI is to fix bugs related to our Inventory Wordpress plugin, our Inventory Management system, and our Inventory Processor. My job is kind of the "catch-all" of the company. If there is a problem with one of our 5000+ Wordpress sites, most likely the SalesForce ticket will make it to us!

## ðŸ¥‡ Additional Projects
### **Lightpost Mobile App**
Over the last year or so, I have been working with the creator of [Lightpost](https://lightpost.app) to help create a maintain a mobile app using React Native. Initially, the Lightpost mobile app was a Turbolinks app, but the need for a native application on iOS and Android became a priority. At first, I used Redux to persist data accross the app, but later removed it for Context and updated all components from class level components to hooks.
